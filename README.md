# Mobile-Pet-Quarantine-Unit
Welcome to our website! We are Team 6: Change Makers, and we came together to work on this project which was introduced to us by a local pet shelter,
the Franklin All Animal Rescue team. They presented us with an issue we could potentially solve, which was to design a mobile pet rescue quarantine unit.
In the following file we as a team used Onshape a CAD software to design cages for a quarantine unit and then 3D printed them.
